## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a Single Page Application (SPA) without relying on any JavaScript framework. Instead, it leverages native Web Components and utilizes browser-specific DOM APIs, allowing you to run it without the need for any build step. This approach embraces the simplicity of using the web platform directly, promoting a lightweight and straightforward development process.
